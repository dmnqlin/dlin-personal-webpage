  abstract = {This chapter addresses, in a process-sociological perspective, the thorny issue of terror and terrorism, which dominates the political and scholarly debate on contemporary forms of violence. Elias’ late studies on the problem of violence in the process of German nationalisation – both in the paroxysmal form of the National Socialist terror regime and in the more sporadic form of extreme left-wing terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s – help to shift the focus on this issue. The crucial point is to consider the negative effects of the increasing functional democratisation of European mass societies. Rather than seeing terrorism and other warlike attitudes and behaviours as a simple “throwback” to “archaic” violence, it highlights the “regressive” aspect of these typically modern expressions of violence, which appear to be a reaction from within to the civilisation process. The driving force behind the threat of a ’breakdown of civilisation” resulting from a fanatical engagement in violence must be sought in the noogenetic process: the more society progresses, the more ideological radicalisation precedes brutal deeds.},
